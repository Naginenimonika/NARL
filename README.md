**ABSTRACT**:


Noise Removal and Peak Picking of Advanced Indian MST Radar Wind Velocity Data Using Neural Networks.The Advanced Indian MST (Mesosphere, Stratosphere and Troposphere) Radar situated at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), Gadanki is a fully active phased array radar built to study the atmosphere and near-Earth space. It operates in the VHF band at 53MHz using a 32x32 antenna array, each radiating a power of 1kW. The radar data can be used to generate wind velocity-range plots which is useful for atmospheric studies. The data, however, gets contaminated with noise at higher altitudes due to various factors. This project aims to study the characteristics of such noise and eliminate it to produce denoised data using Neural Networks. Subsequently, peak picking is done and clean plots are generated.
